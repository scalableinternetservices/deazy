1. First I checkout version 3.0 of Diffutils into a new branch named "quote" by
	 git checkout v3.0 -b quote

2. Then, I install the change to this branch using the patch by
	 patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt

I get the following 

	patching file src/cmp.c
	patching file src/diff.c
	patching file src/diff3.c
	patching file src/dir.c
	patching file src/sdiff.c	
	patching file src/util.c
	

3. I learned how to use the "add-change-log-entry-other window" command (C-x 4 a).

4. I created a new ChangeLog Entry using the command described in setp 4. The content
of the ChangeLog entry was borrowed from the original entry that was found in
git-log.txt.
	With the following emacs
	  C-x 4 a
	  C-x C-s
	  C-x C-c

5. We add the changes and commit them to the new branch using the ChangeLog entry as
the commit message.
	  git add .
	  git commit -m "ChangeLog"ema 


6. Then I used the command git format-patch to create a new patch file
     git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt


7. I worked with my partner. We sent each other our formatted-patch.txt file and I uploaded his to the SEASnet server. Then, I switched to a new branch called partner. I used the git am command to apply his formatted patch. Then, I build test his patch with the commands we used
before. The results are as expected.
	  git checkout v3.0 -b partner
	  git am ../ds-formatted-patch.txt
	  ./bootstrap
	  ./configure
	  make
	  make check


8. I used the command make distdir to verify that the ChangeLog worked. We look
at the resulting ChangeLog file in the created diffutils-3.0.1-a7cc folder. We
find that the output of his ChangeLog is in fact there. Therefore, the patch
was successful. My partner also found that my patch works successfully on his
computer as well.
	   make distdir
	   emacs diffutils-3.0.1-a7cc/ChangeLog

9. Now, we inspect the emacs repository with gitk. We first exit the server and open
it up with -X allow X-forwarding. We then change the directory into emacs one and run the gitk command. A new browser pops up of the repository. We scroll through
and find the newest merge that is not newer than 2015-01-25


	 ssh -X saibalaj@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu
	  cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
	  gitk

The description of the roles of the subwindows we see is in gitk-description.txt.
