1. First got connected to the Beaglebone board via the. lab WiFi: CR3760-wifi
	SSID: CR3760-wifi       IP : 10.97.85.125

2. Then ssh to my beaglebone as root via ssh root@192.168.8.1

	However, I noticed that I was not asked for typing password which allows everyone to log into my board.
3. I set up the passwprd
	passwd #change: 8569

4. First, I install two packages, xauth and xterm
	
	apt-get install xauth
	apt-get install xterm

4. Then to avoid confusion, I set up a host name to "AMZBB"
	hostname AMZBB
	
5. Then I got connected to the lab WiFi with board

6. Then I got connected to my partner BeagleBone

	ssh root@10.97.85.136
	his password: 123123
	root@jonathan:~# : in my partner's board

7. Then I logged out from my partner's board
	logout

8. Then I created a non-root user account for my partner to log in, I did this by using useradd and passwd commands
	
	useradd newUser
	passwd newUser host:8569!


9. The I made a home Directory for the new user.

	I did this by 	mkdir /home/newUser
	chown newUser /home/newUser

10. Then I got  connceted to my partner's board with the newly created user account
	 ssh ali@10.97.85.136
	password: 8569

11. Then I used the ssh* to allow me to ssh to my partner's board without typing any password

	ssh-keygen to create public/private key on my board
	ssh-copy-id ali@10.97.85.25
	eeval `ssh-agent`
	ssh-add

12. Finally, I closed all the terminals connected to BBG.

13. Then I ssh to mt BB with -X option and then from my BB to ssh to my partner's BB  with. -X option
	ssh -X root@192.168.8.1
then to my partenr's
	ssh -X root@10.97.85.25
14. Then I invoked xterm command on my partner's board with my ssh session.
